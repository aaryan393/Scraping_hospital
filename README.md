# Web Scraping and Training Private GPT Model

## Overview
This project involves scraping doctors' profiles, treatments, and department information from three top hospitals' websites (Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and Mass General) and then training a private GPT model using the scraped data. The cleaned and processed data is combined into a readable format for the model to be trained on.

 I utilize the [Private GPT Model](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt) as the core AI model for this project. This GPT model allows for secure and localized training on private data, making it ideal for our application in healthcare.

## Features
- Scrapes doctor profiles, roles, locations, and areas of focus from multiple hospital websites.
- Combines data from three hospitals into a single dataset.
- Converts the scraped data into a format suitable for training a private GPT model.
- Integrates with the Private GPT model for interactive use.
## Key Points:
- The scraping and data processing are done in a single Jupyter notebook.
- The instructions guide users through scraping, combining data, and training the Private GPT model.
## Interaction Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of interactions with the trained Private GPT model:

This README gives users a structured overview of how to run the project and train the Private GPT model.
